## Platform
- It refers to the environment or system where a game is designed to run.

## Types of Game Platform
- **Arcade Games** are stand alone game systems found in public venues—such as video arcades, bowling alleys, amusement parks, and pizza parlors. Most games are played standing up—with player controls consisting of buttons, joysticks, or a combination.
- **Console systems** are usually played in the home, hooked up to a television set. The console platform is proprietary which means that hardware manufacturers such as Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have control over what software is developed for their respective platforms
- **Computer Games** are played on desktop computers and laptops. The computer platform adds complexity to the development process due to non-standard setups and a variety of systems.
- **Online Games** are played on a computer platform or through a console system connected to the Internet. The largest online games involve thousands of simultaneous players, which sometimes requires that the information for the game be stored on several servers
- **Handheld Device** is a lightweight, portable game console with a built-in screen, game controls, and speakers. The small size of handheld devices makes it convenient for them to be taken with the player almost anywhere
- **Mobile Games** are games designed for mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and portable media players. Mobile devices have a wide range of connectivity features allowing wireless multiplayer games.
- **Tabletop Games** are played on top of tables. These include board, card, and dice games, and even pen-and-paper games such as Dungeons and Dragons, where the game pieces literally consist of pens and paper.
